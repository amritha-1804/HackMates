# REVERSE TYPING PROJECT üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: HackMates


### Team Members
- Member 1: Amritha M S - College of Engineering Poonjar
- Member 2: Niranjana D Rao - College of Engineering Poonjar

### Project Description
The Reverse Typing Project is a fun web app that instantly displays whatever you type in reverse order. It uses JavaScript string manipulation and event handling to transform input in real time, making it a quirky yet educational example of interactive programming.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The problem is that normal typing always appears in the correct order, so there‚Äôs no easy way to watch your words appear backward in real time ‚Äî until this project came along.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
It solves the completely unnecessary problem of reading your own text backward ‚Äî something no one actually needs, but now you can do instantly for fun, curiosity, or confusing your friends.
